Project Title: Jose Maceda Collection Web Portal

Project Manager: Dr. Jaime Caro 
Adviser:  Mrs. Sonia Pascua

Project Description

	The Jose Maceda Collection reflects the traditional music of the Philippines and parts of South East Asia, covering sixty-eight ethnolinguistic groups, before many musical styles vanished or substantially changed as a result of the process of social change, modern civilization and cultural globalization. In this project, we will be creating a web portal wherein users can search through the Internet for any item included in the Jose Maceda Collection. The main beneficiary of this project is the Center for Ethnomusicology where the collection is housed. This is a step for the Center to broaden its network with other scholars and academe from around the globe.

The objectives of this project are as follows:

Develop an online portal wherein users can search for any item  that is a part of  the Jose Maceda Collection, get its detailed descriptions and its catalog number as its locator. This website will also provide Information about the Center for Ethnomusicology of the UP College of Music and how they can be granted access to the collection.
Develop an administration interface (in the form of web pages) where administrators can search, add, edit or delete information about the collection.
Develop user interface (in the form of web pages) where they can view, search and inquire information about the collection.
 
Hardware and Software Requirements

PHP
MySQL

The system on which the application will be hosted will depend on the advice of the Center of Ethnomusicology.
